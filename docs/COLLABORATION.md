# Real-Time Collaboration Features

## Overview

The Content Creator now supports real-time collaboration allowing multiple users to work together on the same project simultaneously.

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Real-Time Synchronization
- **Slide Updates**: All slide changes are synchronized in real-time
- **Block Updates**: Text block modifications, positioning, and styling are shared instantly
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection when multiple users edit the same element
- **Conflict Resolution**: UI prompts to resolve editing conflicts

### âœ… User Presence
- **Online Users**: See who else is currently working on the project
- **Active Slide Indicators**: Know which slide each collaborator is viewing
- **Color-Coded Users**: Each user has a unique color for identification

### âœ… Live Cursors
- **Real-Time Cursors**: See other users' mouse cursors moving on the canvas
- **User Labels**: Cursors show the user's name
- **Throttled Updates**: Optimized for performance (10 FPS)

### âœ… Commenting System
- **Add Comments**: Cmd/Ctrl + double-click to add comments anywhere on slides
- **Real-Time Comments**: Comments appear instantly for all users
- **Comment Resolution**: Mark comments as resolved when addressed
- **Visual Indicators**: Blue dots show comment locations

### âœ… Collaboration UI
- **User Setup**: Simple project ID system for joining collaboration sessions
- **Presence Panel**: Shows all active collaborators and their current slide
- **Collaboration Toggle**: Enable/disable collaboration mode
- **Conflict Notifications**: Clear UI for resolving editing conflicts

## Getting Started

### 1. Start the Development Servers
```bash
npm run dev:full
```
This starts both the Next.js dev server (port 3000) and Socket.io server (port 3001).

### 2. Enable Collaboration
- Click the "Collaboration Off" button in the header to enable collaboration
- Enter your name and either generate a new project ID or enter an existing one
- Share the project ID with collaborators

### 3. Invite Collaborators
- Share the project ID with team members
- They can join by entering the same project ID
- Up to 8 users can collaborate simultaneously (color-coded)

## Usage

### Real-Time Editing
- All text edits, block movements, and slide changes sync automatically
- Changes appear within 100-500ms for optimal performance
- Conflicts are detected and resolved through UI prompts

### Adding Comments
- Hold **Cmd/Ctrl** and **double-click** anywhere on a slide
- Type your comment and press Enter or click "Add Comment"
- Comments are visible to all collaborators immediately
- Click comment dots to view/resolve comments

### User Presence
- See collaborators in the presence panel (top-right)
- Green dots indicate users on the same slide
- User cursors show real-time mouse movements

### Conflict Resolution
- When conflicts occur, a modal appears with options:
  - "Keep Their Changes" - Accept the other user's version
  - "Keep My Changes" - Keep your version
- Conflicts are rare but handled gracefully

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React components with custom hooks for collaboration
- **Backend**: Socket.io server for real-time communication
- **State Management**: Local state synchronized via WebSocket events
- **Conflict Detection**: Timestamp-based conflict detection (500ms-1s threshold)

### Performance Optimizations
- **Throttled Cursor Updates**: 10 FPS to reduce bandwidth
- **Debounced Text Updates**: 300ms delay for text editing
- **Selective Broadcasting**: Only broadcast significant changes
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of inactive projects

### Data Flow
1. User makes change â†’ Local state update
2. Change broadcast via Socket.io â†’ Other users receive update
3. Conflict detection â†’ Resolution if needed
4. State synchronization â†’ All users see final state

## Remaining Features

### ðŸ”„ Permission System (Pending)
- Role-based access (View/Edit/Admin)
- Granular permissions for slides and blocks
- Project ownership and sharing controls

### ðŸ”„ Version History (Pending)
- Complete change tracking
- Rollback to previous versions
- Diff visualization
- Blame/attribution for changes

## File Structure

```
lib/
  collaboration.ts          # Core collaboration manager
components/collaboration/
  UserPresence.tsx         # User presence panel
  UserCursors.tsx          # Real-time cursor display
  Comments.tsx             # Commenting system
  ConflictResolution.tsx   # Conflict resolution UI
  UserSetup.tsx            # Project joining interface
server/
  socket.js                # Socket.io server
```

## Environment Variables

```env
SOCKET_PORT=3001  # Socket.io server port (optional, defaults to 3001)
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Project IDs**: Currently use simple string IDs (not authenticated)
2. **Persistence**: Projects only persist in memory (restart clears data)
3. **Scalability**: Single server instance (no clustering)
4. **Security**: No authentication or authorization yet

## Future Enhancements

- Authentication integration (Auth0/NextAuth)
- Database persistence (Supabase/PostgreSQL)
- Real-time voice/video chat integration
- Advanced permission system
- Project templates and sharing
- Mobile collaboration support
